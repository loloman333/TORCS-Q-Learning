# TORCS-Q-Learning

Please note that this code is a complete disaster.
This was a school project and I didn't want to spend too much time on it.
See: https://github.com/loloman333/Cart-Pole-Q-Learning for a QLearning application on a simpler problem.

I appreciate that you like the code, but I think it will be a lot of work if you're trying to get somethig useful out of it for other students.
